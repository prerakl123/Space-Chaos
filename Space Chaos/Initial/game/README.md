Space Chaos is a two-dimensional game with the player being in control of the spaceship
The meteors being thrown at the space ship need to be destroyed in order to protect the ship
and achieve a good score. The player can move the ship in all directions. 

The meteors are randomly thrown by the Invincible Ultimate Destroyer who doesn't like to show himself
in the open and therefore remains hidden. 

In the mod or the infinite one player doesn't have any control over firing beams and number of lives and
can play as much as wanted by the player. 

But as the legends say there are always twists and turns in life,
similarly the vertically downward movement of the spaceship is restricted.
The player can ascend as fast as he wants but won't be able to descend at the same rate 'cause there ARE 
restrictions.
