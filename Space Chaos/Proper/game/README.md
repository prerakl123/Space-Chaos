Space Chaos is a two-dimensional game with the player being in control of the spaceship
The meteors being thrown at the space ship need to be destroyed in order to protect the ship
and achieve a good score. The player can move the ship in all directions. 

The meteors are randomly thrown by the Invincible Ultimate Destroyer who doesn't like to show himself
in the open and therefore remains hidden.
